Chat-Me-PT is Troy's creation. It is this very project where users can chat with
an LLM agent about Troy's work experiences and other personal details. The
backend at https://github.com/troy-fulton/chat-me-pt-backend contains a Django
app that makes an in-memory document index available for searching and
prompting. This serves as the new version of Troy's ePortfolio, enhancing its
functionality with interactive generative AI.

This project is hosted (frontend and backend) in Railway, a kubernetes-like
environment for fast deployment.
